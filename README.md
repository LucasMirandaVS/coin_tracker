# Crypto Data Pipeline

A lightweight and containerized pipeline for collecting historical data from cryptocurrencies and uploading it to Google BigQuery.

## What the pipeline does

1. Loads all CSVs from the `data/` folder (recursively)
2. Concatenates the data into a unified DataFrame
3. Uploads the data to a partitioned table in BigQuery
4. Data is displayed in a dashboard in Looker Studio

---

##  How to Run Locally

### Requirements:
- Python 3.12+
- Google Cloud credentials in JSON format
- CoinGecko API Key
- BigQuery dataset already created

### Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file with:
```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=secrets/project-credentials.json
COINGECKO_API_KEY=insertyourapikeyhere
```

## Run with Docker

### Build and run
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> Make sure the credentials file exists in `secrets/` and is mapped inside the container.

## 💸 GCP Costs (approximate)
- **BigQuery storage**: First 10 GB free, then $0.02/GB/month
- **BigQuery queries**: 1 TB free/month, then $5/TB
- **Cloud Run job**: Charged only while running (first 2 million requests free/month)
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Free up to 3 jobs/month

---

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Enable logging and alerting
- Validate schema before upload
- Connect to Looker Studio (ex-Google Data Studio)
- Parametrize coin list or add CLI options
